MetaDrive Macro Environment

MetaDrive Macro Environment is a control option based RL environment on MetaDrive.
It is similar with `highway-env <https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env>`_, in which
the ego vehicle aims to keep a high velocity on a multi-lane highway with some slower
vehicles. The env use a top-down view as input and outputs a discrete macro action.
The macro action takes effect in a following time period in simulator, and the vehicle
is drived by a IDM policy that can achieve the target macro action.

Environments
================

The environment is established following the standard ``gym.Env`` form. Detail information
is listed below.

The state of macro env is Top-down Sematic Maps containing 5 channels:

- Road and navigation
- Ego now and previous position 
- Neighbor at step ``t``
- Neighbor at ``t-1``
- Neighbor at ``t-2``

All map elements are in the same relative coordinate system.

Reward: 

- driving reward: driving distance along the lane.
- speed reward: the faster, the larger
- termination reward: containing success and failure case

Action: 

- Speed up
- Slow down
- Change lane left
- Change lane right
- Hold speed

Each action costs 30 system timestep, and is converted to control signals through a PID controller.


Training & Test
======================

All the entry can be found in ``demo/metadrive``

DI-drive provide two RL policy training entries: DQN and Discrete PPO. Run the following
scripts to start training DQN demos.

.. code:: python

    cd demo/metadrive
    python macro_env_dqn_train.py

You may need to modify the collector and evaluator nums according to your resources.

.. code:: python

    metadrive_macro_config = dict(
        env=dict(
            collector_env_num=14,
            ...
        ),
        ...
    )

After training, you can visualize the performance by running the following script:

.. code:: python

    python macro_env_dqn_eval.py

You may need to change the checkpoint path in config. Here we provide a pre-trained
DQN weights as example.
